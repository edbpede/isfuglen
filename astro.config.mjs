       * preview paginates. A CSP that silently disabled pagination would be a
       * worse outcome than a permissive `style-src`, which is not an
       * exfiltration path here — `default-src 'self'` still governs every URL a
       * stylesheet could reference.
       *
       * `'unsafe-inline'` is nonetheless inert, and `build.inlineStylesheets:
       * "never"` does not rescue it: Astro emits its own
       * `astro-island{display:contents}` rule inline for hydration, so a style
       * hash is always present and browsers ignore `'unsafe-inline'` whenever
       * one is. It stays declared because a host that serves this without the
       * island runtime would have no hash and would then need it.
       *
       * The practical consequence, and the reason it is written down here: run
       * time styling has to go through the CSSOM. `element.style.someProperty`
       * and `CSSStyleSheet`/`adoptedStyleSheets` are unaffected;
       * `setAttribute("style", …)` is refused outright and a `<style>` element
       * built in JavaScript is refused with it. `src/lib/export/paint.ts` and
       * the Paged.js polisher redirect in `src/lib/export/pdf.ts` both take the
       * CSSOM route for exactly this reason.
