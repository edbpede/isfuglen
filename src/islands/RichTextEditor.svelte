  /**
   * A TipTap instance over one section's body — docs/PLAN.md §7.3.
   *
   * Three rules are encoded here, and each of them is a bug that would otherwise
   * be found late:
   *
   * 1. One `$effect`, with cleanup. TipTap owns real DOM and real event
   *    listeners; failing to `destroy()` on section removal leaks them.
   * 2. The editor is uncontrolled. `NewsletterDoc` is updated *from* it, never
   *    fed back into it — doing so causes cursor jumps and, with runes, an
   *    `effect_update_depth_exceeded` loop.
   * 3. Lazy mount on first focus. Until then the section renders as static HTML
   *    identical to the preview, which keeps a fifteen-section document at one or
   *    two live ProseMirror instances and makes the first paint after a parse
   *    instant.
   *
   * TipTap and its schema are imported at that same moment rather than at module
   * scope. An editor nobody has focused yet has no business costing ~90 KB gz of
   * the initial workspace payload, and the plan's budget is not met without this
   * (§6.4). The type-only import above compiles away entirely.

   * exactly once per mount, and tracking them alone is both correct and

   * Everything else the editor is built from — `blocks`, `t`, `labelledBy`,

   * load-bearing, not incidental: `onUpdate` hands the parent a fresh `blocks`
